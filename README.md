# Script-OLT-Migration
This code reads tables in Excel to generate OLT migration scripts. I export the data and make my code read the spreadsheet and generate scripts for migration. We have already migrated more than 3,000 clients at once. Previously, it took us more than two days to do this, but now it is executed in seconds.
